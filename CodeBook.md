A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work
that I performed to clean up the data for Course Project Module 3

Main variables and its descriptions are used and they are as follows:

ytest = function to read y_test.txt
ytrain = function to read y_train.txt
xtest = function to read x_test.txt
xtrain = function to read the y_train.txt
strain = function to read subject_train.txt
stest = function to read subject_test.txt
ydata = binded ytrain and ytest
xdata = binded xtrain and xtest
subdata = binded strain and stest
data = binded files of x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test, subject_train, and subject_test.
data2 = shows only the mean and standard deviation measurements.
data3 = function for second independent data with average on each variable.

subjectactivityaverage.txt - independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
for each activity and each subject located on my current working directory.
